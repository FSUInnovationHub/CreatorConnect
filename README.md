# CreatorConnect

CreatorConnect is a web app hosted by the Florida State University Innovation Hub to allow students with technical and innovative skills to advertise their skills to the FSU community and employers for the purpose of accessing enriching opportunities that include engaging on projects, internships, tutoring, and employment. Currently the program is in the developmental phase and over the fall of 2019 we created a beta version for it. The CreatorConnect beta version 

* Uses MongoDB as a relational database.
* Uses Flask to host a secure backend server with multiple endpoints.
* Uses ReactJS to host a web app that connects to the Flask endpoints in order to process data.
* Uses ReactJS to dynamically render HTML components based on the endpointâ€™s response. 
* Uses CSS techniques to allow for access and compatibility on all devices.

Currently, we are working with a focus group to see which features they would like to see implemented into the public release version of the web app. We expect this beta period to last six weeks after which the beta will be taken down and the consumer application will be set to debut. The consumer application will be released on April 1, 2020.
